## Building documentation

This package uses roxygen2 and pkgdown.

To generate RD files:

```r
devtools::document()
```

To build the pkgdown website:

```r
pkgdown::build_site()
```

To rebuild the README.md:

```r
devtools::build_readme()
```

Do **not edit** the `README.md` file, instead work on the `README.rmd` and generate a new `README.md`.
